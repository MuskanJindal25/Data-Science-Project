# Data-Science-Project

## Boston Housing Violations Analysis
### Description
The project's aim is to analyze building violations data from the City fo Boston to identify systemic housing issues.
Using violation records from the given datasets, we aim to provide actionable insights to improve hosuing quality.

### Goal(s)
Identify clusters of chronic housing vialoations and correlate them with:
- Property characteristics
- Neighbourhoods/Communitites
-  and any other common features.

### Dataset(s)

- [Public Works Violations Dataset](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/public-works-violations)
- [Building and Property Violations Dataset](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/building-and-property-violations1)
- [Property Assessment Dataset](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/property-assessment)
- [Live Street Address Management Dataset](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/live-street-address-management-sam-addresses)

### Data Modelling
The current ideas are: 
- Clustering the data to identify vioaltion hotspots
- Predictive analysis to preidct the risk of violations.

### Data Visualization
Current plans for visualization are:
- Heatmaps and 
- Scatterplots to explore relationships between variables.

### Test plans

The test plan is two try two different splits:
 1. Time based split for temporal analysis validations, and
 2. Randomized split for generalizability.
